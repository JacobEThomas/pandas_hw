1.) While there are many more male players than female, the data suggests that females make slightly more purchases than males (1.4 vs 1.35).
Thus, we should launch a marketing campaign that targets females because they make more purchases, on average.

2.) The great majority of players are between the ages of 15-24, however the highest spenders are <10 and 35-39. We may need
to take a look at credit card security with the <10 year olds to make sure that they have permission from their parents
to make purchases. The last thing we want is an angry parent threatening to dispute their credit card charges because
their child used their card in an unauthorized manner.

3.) Despair, Favor of Due Diligence is the most popular item. We should look at the attributes of that item, and perhaps
make another item with similar abilities or offer a paid upgrade so that current users may spend more money.
